# What to do with which package?

**flutter_it is a construction set** - each package solves a specific problem. Use one, combine several, or use them all together. This guide helps you choose the right tools for your needs.

## Quick Decision Guide

| You need to... | Use this package |
|----------------|------------------|
| Access services/dependencies anywhere in your app | **get_it** |
| Update UI automatically when data changes | **watch_it** + **get_it** |
| Handle async actions with loading/error states | **command_it** |
| Transform, combine reactive data or use observable collections | **listen_it** |

## Why these packages?

Good Flutter architecture follows key principles: **separation of concerns**, **single source of truth**, and **testability**. The flutter_it packages help you implement these principles without the complexity of traditional frameworks.

## The Problems Each Package Solves

### 🎯 get_it - Access anything, anywhere

**Problem**: How do I access services, business logic, and shared data without passing it through the widget tree?

**Solution**: Service locator pattern - register once, access anywhere without BuildContext.

**Use when**:
- You need dependency injection without the widget tree
- You want to share services across your app
- You need control over object lifecycle (singletons, factories, scopes)
- You want to test your business logic independently

**Example use case**: Accessing an API service from anywhere in your app.

### 👁️ watch_it - Reactive UI updates

**Problem**: How do I update my UI when data changes without setState() or complex state management?

**Solution**: Watch ValueListenable/ChangeNotifier and rebuild automatically - you'll almost never need StatefulWidget again.

**Use when**:
- You want automatic UI updates on data changes
- You want to eliminate StatefulWidget and setState() boilerplate
- You need fine-grained rebuilds (only affected widgets)
- You're tired of manually managing subscriptions

**Example use case**: A counter widget that rebuilds when the count changes.

**Requires**: get_it for service location

### ✋ command_it - Smart action encapsulation

**Problem**: How do I handle async operations with loading states, errors, and enable/disable logic without repetitive boilerplate?

**Solution**: Command pattern with built-in state management - handle exceptions the smart way.

**Use when**:
- You have async operations (API calls, database operations)
- You need loading indicators and error handling
- You want to enable/disable actions based on conditions
- You want reusable, testable action logic

**Example use case**: A save button that shows loading state, handles errors, and can be disabled.

### 👂 listen_it - Reactive primitives

**Problem**: How do I transform, combine, filter reactive data? How do I make collections observable?

**Solution**: RxDart-like operators for ValueNotifier that are easy to understand, plus reactive collections (ListNotifier, MapNotifier, SetNotifier).

**Use when**:
- You need to transform ValueListenable data (map, where, debounce)
- You need to combine multiple ValueListenables into one
- You want observable Lists, Maps, or Sets that notify on changes
- You need reactive data pipelines without RxDart complexity

**Example use case**: Debouncing search input, or a shopping cart that notifies on item changes.

## Common Package Combinations

### Minimal Setup: get_it + watch_it
Perfect for apps that need dependency injection and reactive UI. Covers 90% of typical app needs.

**Example**: Most CRUD apps, dashboard apps, form-heavy apps.

### Full Stack: All 4 packages
Complete reactive architecture with dependency injection, reactive UI, command pattern, and data transformations.

**Example**: Complex apps with API integration, real-time updates, and sophisticated state transformations.

### Standalone Use Cases

Each package works independently:

- **Just get_it**: Simple dependency injection without reactivity
- **Just listen_it**: Reactive operators/collections without dependency injection
- **Just command_it**: Command pattern for encapsulating actions

## Architecture Principles

### Why separate your code into layers?

flutter_it packages enable clean architecture by solving specific problems that arise when you separate concerns:

**The Goal**: Keep business logic separate from UI, maintain a single source of truth, make everything testable.

**The Challenge**: Once you move data out of widgets, you need:
1. A way to access that data from anywhere → **get_it** solves this
2. A way to update UI when data changes → **watch_it** solves this
3. A way to handle async operations cleanly → **command_it** solves this
4. A way to transform and combine reactive data → **listen_it** solves this

### Separation of concerns

Different parts of your application should have different responsibilities:

- **UI layer**: Displays data and handles user interactions
- **Business logic layer**: Processes data and implements app rules
- **Services layer**: Communicates with external systems (APIs, databases, device features)

By separating these layers, you can:
- Change one part without affecting others
- Test business logic without UI
- Reuse logic across different screens

### Single source of truth

Each piece of data should live in exactly one place. If you have a list of users, there should be one list, not multiple copies across different widgets.

Benefits:
- Data stays consistent across your app
- Updates happen in one place
- Easier to debug and maintain

### Testability

Your app should be designed for easy testing:
- Business logic can be tested without Flutter widgets
- Services can be mocked for unit tests
- UI can be tested independently with test data
