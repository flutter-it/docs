title: Welcome to Flutter_it!

<Info> This is a work in progress. The documentation is not yet complete. </Info>

Flutter-it is a collection of packages that help you build well organized, performant, testable and maintainable Flutter applications with ease. 
Each package focuses on specific problems one may encounter while developing Flutter applications.

The current packages solve the following problems:

- [`get_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) is a simple service locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies. It can be used instead of `InheritedWidget` or `Provider` to access objects e.g. from your UI.
- [`watch_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/watch_it) is a simple state management solution powered by get_it.
- [`command_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/command_it) gives you more control over your state management by using the `Command` design pattern and sophisticated error handling.
- [`listen_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/listen_it) lets you work with `ValueListenable` the way you are used to from the `Stream` and ReactiveExtensions API.

My packages follow what I call the "LEGO" approach. Instead of offering one big package that does everything, I offer a set of packages that each solve a specific problem. This way you can pick and choose the packages that best fit your needs and you can easily mix and match them.

I try to make my APIs as simple and intuitive as possible if possible without any need for boilerplate code.

If you are new to Flutter-it, you might want to start with the [What to do with which package](getting_started/what_to_do_with_which_package) page.

Enjoy!
