title: How to contribute
----

Maintaining this project is a lot of work. I try to keep the documentation up to date and the packages stable.
If you are as excited about this project as I am, you can help me by:

* Helping me extending the documentation, although the readmes are pretty extensive they seem not to be as approachable as they could be. Especially for new users.
* Provide small sample projects that show how to use the packages.
* get involved in our discussion on github [here](https://github.com/orgs/flutter-it/discussions) or on [discord](https://discord.gg/g5hUvhRz)
