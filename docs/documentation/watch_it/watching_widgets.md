# WatchingWidgets

## Why Do You Need Special Widgets?

You might wonder: "Why can't I just use `watchValue()` in a regular `StatelessWidget`?"

**The problem:** watch_it needs to hook into your widget's lifecycle to:
1. **Subscribe** to changes when the widget builds
2. **Unsubscribe** when the widget is disposed (prevent memory leaks)
3. **Rebuild** the widget when data changes

Regular `StatelessWidget` doesn't give watch_it access to these lifecycle events. You need a widget that watch_it can hook into.

## WatchingWidget - For Widgets Without Local State

Replace `StatelessWidget` with `WatchingWidget`:

<<< @/../code_samples/lib/watch_it/watching_widgets_patterns.dart#watching_widget_basic

**Use this when:**
- Writing new widgets
- You don't need local state (`setState`)
- Simple reactive UI

## WatchingStatefulWidget - For Widgets With Local State

Use when you need both `setState` AND reactive state:

<<< @/../code_samples/lib/watch_it/watching_widgets_patterns.dart#watching_stateful_widget

**Use this when:**
- You need local UI state (search queries, form input, expansion state)
- You need animation controllers
- Mix `setState` with reactive updates

**Note:** Your State class automatically gets all watch functions - no mixin needed!

## Alternative: Using Mixins

If you have **existing widgets** you don't want to change, use mixins instead:

### For Existing StatelessWidget

<<< @/../code_samples/lib/watch_it/watching_widgets_patterns.dart#mixin_stateless

### For Existing StatefulWidget

<<< @/../code_samples/lib/watch_it/watching_widgets_patterns.dart#mixin_stateful

**Why use mixins?**
- Keep existing class hierarchy
- Can use `const` constructors with `WatchItMixin`
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Perfect for gradual migration

## Quick Decision Guide

**New widget, no local state?**
→ Use `WatchingWidget`

**New widget WITH local state?**
→ Use `WatchingStatefulWidget`

**Migrating existing StatelessWidget?**
→ Add `with WatchItMixin`

**Migrating existing StatefulWidget?**
→ Add `with WatchItStatefulWidgetMixin` to the StatefulWidget (not the State!)
