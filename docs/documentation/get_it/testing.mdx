title: Testing with GetIt
---

## Unit Tests

When you are writing unit tests with GetIt in your App you have two possibilities:

- Register all the Objects you need inside your unit Tests so that GetIt can provide its objects to the objects that you are testing.
- Pass your dependent objects into the constructor of your test objects like:

```dart
GetIt getIt = GetIt.instance;

class UserManager {
  AppModel appModel;
  DbService dbService;

  UserManager({AppModel? appModel, DbService? dbService}) {
    this.appModel = appModel ?? getIt.get<AppModel>();
    this.dbService = dbService ?? getIt.get<DbService>();
  }
}
```

This way you don't need to pass them in the `AppModel` and `dbService` inside your App but you can pass them (or a mocked version) in your Unit tests.

### Integration Tests

If you have a mocked version of a Service, you can easily switch between that and the real one based on a flag:

```dart
  if (testing) {
    getIt.registerSingleton<AppModel>(AppModelMock());
  } else {
    getIt.registerSingleton<AppModel>(AppModelImplementation());
  }
```
