## Asynchronous Factories

If a factory needs to call an async function you can use `registerFactoryAsync()`

```dart
/// [T] type to register
/// [func] factory function for this type
/// [instanceName] if you provide a value here your factory gets registered with that
/// name instead of a type. This should only be necessary if you need to register more
/// than one instance of one type.
void registerFactoryAsync<T>(FactoryFuncAsync<T> func, {String instanceName});
```

To access instances created by such a factory you can't use `get()` but you have to use `getAsync()` so that
you can await the creation of the requested new instance.

```dart
/// Returns a Future of an instance that is created by an async factory or a Singleton that is
/// not ready with its initialization.
Future<T> getAsync<T>([String instanceName]);
```

## Asynchronous Singletons

Additionally, you can register asynchronous Singletons which means Singletons that have an initialization that requires async function calls. To be able to control such asynchronous start-up behaviour GetIt supports mechanisms to ensure the correct initialization sequence.

You create a Singleton with an asynchronous creation function

```dart
  void registerSingletonAsync<T>(FactoryFuncAsync<T> factoryfunc,
      {String instanceName,
      Iterable<Type> dependsOn,
      bool signalsReady = false});
```

The difference to a normal Singleton is that you don't pass an existing instance but provide a factory function
that returns a `Future` that completes at the end of `factoryFunc` and signals that the Singleton is ready to use unless `true` is passed for `signalsReady`. (see next chapter)
To synchronize with other "async Singletons" you can pass a list of `Type`s in `dependsOn` that have to be ready before the passed factory is executed.

There are two ways to signal the system that an instance is ready.

## Synchronizing asynchronous initializations of Singletons

Often your registered services need to do asynchronous initialization work before they can be used from the rest of the app. As this is such a common task, and it's closely related to registration/initialization GetIt supports you here too.

`GetIt` has the function `allReady` which returns `Future<void>` that can be used e.g. with a Flutter FutureBuilder to await that all asynchronous initialization is finished.

```dart
  Future<void> allReady({Duration timeout, bool ignorePendingAsyncCreation = false});
```

There are different approaches to how the returned Future can be completed:

### Using async Singletons

If you register any async Singletons `allReady` will complete only after all of them have completed their factory functions. Like:

```dart
  class RestService {
    Future<RestService> init() async {
      Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
      return this;
    }
  }

  final getIt = GetIt.instance;

  /// in your setup function:
  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<ConfigService>(() async {
    final configService = ConfigService();
    await configService.init();
    return configService;
  });

  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<RestService>(() async => RestService().init());
  // here we asume an async factory function `createDbServiceAsync`
  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<DbService>(createDbServiceAsync);


  /// ... in your startup page:
  return FutureBuilder(
      future: getIt.allReady(),
      builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return Scaffold(
            body: Center(
              child: Text('The first real Page of your App'),
            ),
          );
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      });
```

The above example shows you different ways to register async Singletons. The start-up page will display a `CircularProgressIndicator` until all services have been created.

### Solving dependencies

### Automatic using `dependsOn`

In a case, these services have to be initialized in a certain order because they depend on that other services are already ready to be used you can use the `dependsOn` parameter of `registerFactoryAsync`. If you have a non-async Singleton that depends on other Singletons, there is `registerSingletonWithDependencies`. In the following example, `DbService` depends on `ConfigService`, and `AppModel` depends on `ConfigService` and `RestService`

```dart
  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<ConfigService>(() async {
    final configService = ConfigService();
    await configService.init();
    return configService;
  });

  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<RestService>(() async => RestService().init());

  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<DbService>(createDbServiceAsync,
      dependsOn: [ConfigService]);

  getIt.registerSingletonWithDependencies<AppModel>(
      () => AppModelImplmentation(),
      dependsOn: [ConfigService, DbService, RestService]);
```

When using `dependsOn` you ensure that the registration waits with creating its singleton on the completion of the type defined in `dependsOn`.

The `dependsOn` field also accepts `InitDependency` classes that allow specifying the dependency by type and `instanceName`.

```dart
  getIt.registerSingletonAsync<RestService>(() async => RestService().init(), instanceName:"rest1");

  getIt.registerSingletonWithDependencies<AppModel>(
      () => AppModelImplmentation(),
      dependsOn: [InitDependency(RestService, instanceName:"rest1")]);
```

### Manually signaling the ready state of a Singleton

Sometimes the mechanism of `dependsOn` might not give you enough control. For this case you can use `isReady` to wait for a certain singleton:

```dart
  /// Returns a Future that completes if the instance of a Singleton, defined by Type [T] or
  /// by name [instanceName] or passing the an existing [instance], is ready
  /// If you pass a [timeout], a [WaitingTimeOutException] will be thrown if the instance
  /// is not ready in the given time. The Exception contains details on which Singletons are
  /// not ready at that time.
  /// [callee] optional parameter which makes debugging easier. Pass `this` in here.
  Future<void> isReady<T>({
    Object instance,
    String instanceName,
    Duration timeout,
    Object callee,
  });
```

To signal that a singleton is ready it can use `signalReady`, provided you have set the optional `signalsReady` parameter when registering it OR make your registration type implement the empty abstract class `WillSignalReady`. Otherwise, `allReady` will wait on a call to signalsReady. No automatic signaling will happen in that case.

```dart
/// Typically this is used in this way inside the registered objects init
/// method `GetIt.instance.signalReady(this);`
void signalReady(Object instance);
```

You can use this to initialize your Singletons without async registration by using fire and forget async function from your constructors like so:

```dart
class ConfigService {
  ConfigService()
  {
    init();
  }
  Future init() async {
    // do your async initialisation...

    GetIt.instance.signalReady(this);
  }
}
```

### Using `allReady` repeatedly

Even if you already have awaited `allReady`, the moment you register new async singletons or singletons with dependencies you can use `allReady` again. This makes especially sense if you use scopes where every scope needs to get initialized.

### Manual triggering **allReady** (almost deprecated)

By calling `signalReady(null)` on your `GetIt` instance the `Future` you can get from `allReady` will be completed.
This is the most basic way to synchronize your start-up. If you want to do that **don't use `signalsReady` or async Singletons**!!!
I recommend using one of the other ways because they are more flexible and express your intention more clear.
