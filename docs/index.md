# Build reactive Flutter apps the easy way

**No codegen, no boilerplate, just code.**

flutter_it is a **modular construction set** of reactive tools for Flutter. Pick what you need, combine as you grow, or use them all together. Each package works independently and integrates seamlessly with the others.

## Why flutter_it?

- ✅ **Zero build_runner** - No code generation, no waiting for builds
- ✅ **Pure Dart** - Works with standard Flutter, no magic
- ✅ **Modular by design** - Use one package or combine several—you choose
- ✅ **Built on ChangeNotifier and ValueNotifier** - Seamless Flutter integration with familiar primitives
- ✅ **Type-safe** - Full compile-time type checking
- ✅ **Battle-tested** - Trusted by thousands of Flutter developers

## See it in action

```dart
// 1. Register services anywhere in your app (get_it)
final getIt = GetIt.instance;
getIt.registerSingleton(CounterModel());

// 2. Watch and react to changes automatically (watch_it)
class CounterWidget extends WatchingWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final count = watchValue((CounterModel m) => m.count);
    return Text('Count: $count'); // Your widget automatically rebuilds on every change
  }
}

// 3. Use reactive collections (listen_it)
final items = ListNotifier<String>();
items.add('New item'); // Automatically notifies listeners

// 4. Encapsulate actions with commands (command_it)
final saveCommand = Command.createAsyncNoResult<UserData>(
  (userData) async => await api.save(userData),
);
// Access loading state, errors - all built-in
```

No setState(), no Provider boilerplate, no code generation. Just reactive Flutter.

## The Construction Set

> 💡 **Each package works standalone** - start with one, add others as needed.

### 🎯 get_it
**Dependency injection without the framework**

Simple service locator that works anywhere in your app—no BuildContext, no InheritedWidget trees, just clean dependency access.

---

### 👁️ watch_it
**Reactive UI updates, automatically**

React to state changes without setState()—watch values and rebuild only what's needed. You'll almost never need a StatefulWidget anymore. Depends on get_it for service location.

---

### ✋ command_it
**Encapsulate actions with built-in state**

Commands that track execution, handle errors, and provide loading states automatically. Handle exceptions the smart way. Perfect for async operations.

---

### 👂 listen_it
**Combine reactive state in an RxDart-like style that's easy to understand**

Transform, filter, combine, and debounce operators for ValueNotifier—plus reactive collections (ListNotifier, MapNotifier, SetNotifier) that automatically notify on changes.
